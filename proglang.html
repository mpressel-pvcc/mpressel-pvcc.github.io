	<tr>
		<th>Machine Language</th>
		<td>An encoding system that sequences instructions using numeric digits. Very tedious.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Debugging</th>
		<td>Locating and correcting errors in a program.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Assembler</th>
		<td>Converts expressions into machine language.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Assembly Language</th>
		<td>A mnemomic system for representing computer programs.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Translator</th>
		<td>Converts high-level programming language into machine language</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Compiler</th>
		<td>Converts multiple sets of machine instructions into shorter sequences to replicate the behavior requested by the high-level primitive. C++ is a compiled language.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Interpreter</td>
		<td>Programs similar to translators. Execute instructions as they are translated instead of saving it all for the end. Python is an interpreted language.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Cross-Platform Software</th>
		<td>Software designed to be used on different types of machine hardware as well as different operating systems. Executable throughout a network.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	<tr>
		<th>Natural Language</th>
		<td>Languages that have evolved over years without formal grammar rules. Human languages are natural.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Formal Language</th>
		<td>Language designed with specific rules from the start. Programming languages are Formal.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>

        <th>Machine Independence</th>
        <td>Being able to run a program on different types of machines as long as they had the appropriate compiler.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>High-Level Programming Language</th>
        <td>Language that allows a program to be written in terms of the problem instead of in terms of the machine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</th>
        <td>A paradigm where a software system is viewed as a group of units able to provide functionality themselves, but also work in tandem with other units (objects)</td>

                <br>
                <li>Tuple: Uses () and is an ordered, but unchangable data collection type. Think a list of unchanging rates. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Set: uses {} and is an unordered, unchangable (as in data in it cannot be changed. Data can be added or removed), and unindexed data collection. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Dictionary: uses {} and is an ordere and changeable data collection that uses key:value pairs and does not allow duplicates.</li>
