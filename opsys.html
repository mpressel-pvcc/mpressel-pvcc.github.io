	<tr>
		<td>Operating System</td>
		<td>The software that controls the overall operation of the computer; including files management, the user interface, and the program execution environment.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Job Queue</td>
		<td>A storage organization used by the operating system to handle how jobs get executed. Most job queues will take job priority into consideration rather than adhere strictly to FIFO.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>FIFO</td>
		<td>First-in, first-out. Where objects are removed from the queue in the order in which they arrived.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Interactive Processing</td>
		<td>A feature in an operating system that allows a user and the program being executed to have a dialogue through remote terminals.  </td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Time-Sharing</td>
		<td>The concept that an operating system can provide service to multiple users at the same time.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Multiprogramming</td>
		<td>An implementation of time sharing where time is divided into intervals and each job execution is restricted to one of the time intervals. At the end of each interval, the operating systems moves to the next job, creating the illusion of several jobs being executed at once.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Application Software</td>
		<td>The programs for performing tasks particular to a machine's utilization. i.e. spreadsheets, accounting systems, games, development software, etc.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	<tr>
		<td>System Software</td>
		<td>The programs for performing tasks that are common to computer systems in general. The infrastructure that is necessary to use application software.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Utility Software</td>
		<td>A type of system software that performs activities that are fundamental to computer installations, but not included in the operating system. Examples would be programs used to format a disk, copy files from a magnetic disk or other storage device, compress or decompress data, or other cusomtizations.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</td>
		<td>The part of the operating system that allows a computer's users to manipulate objects, such as files and programs, that are represented pictorially on the display. Users can interact with these objects in multiple ways. By using the mouse, keyboard, touch screen, or other input device. </td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Shell</td>
		<td>Older uder interfaces that communicated with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Kernel</td>
		<td>The internal part of the operating system. It contains the software components that perform basic functions required by the computer installation.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Device Driver</td>
		<td>A software component of the kernel used to communicate with the controllers to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine. Each driver is designed for a specfic device (Printer, disk drive, monitor, etc.)</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>File Manager</td>
		<td>A software component of the kernel used to coordinate the use of a machine's mass storage. Maintains records of all files stored, including where it is stored, which users can access the files, and which areas of mass storage are available for new files.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Memory Management</td>
		<td>A coponent of the kernel that executes the task of coordinating the machine's use of main memory. The needs are extensive when dealing with multiuser or multitasking environments.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>Virtual Memory</td>
		<td>An illusion of having extra memory created by dividing data into uniformly sized units (called pages,) and then rotating those pages back and forth between main memory and mass storage (a process called paging.)</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Boot Strapping</td>
		<td>Often called booting, this process occurs everytime the computer is turned on. It transfers the operating system from mass storage (where it is permanently stored) into main memory (which is basically empty when the machine is first turned on.)</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ROM</td>
		<td>Nonvolatile memory cells in main memory where the CPU expects to find its initial program.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Deadlock</td>
		<td>The condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource allocated to another.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Spooling</td>
		<td>The technique of holding data for output at a more convenient time.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Super User (or
	Administrator)</td>
		<td>A person with highly priveleged access to the operating system by identifying themself as the administrator (typically via username and password) and can alter settings within the operating system and perform other tasks that are denied to normal users.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Multi-Factor Authentication</td>
		<td>When an account requires more than one piece of evidence to gain access. For example, a password and security questions, or a password and a code emailed to you.</td> <!--Define here!-->
	</tr>
